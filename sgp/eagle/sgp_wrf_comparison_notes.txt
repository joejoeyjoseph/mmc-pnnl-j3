Notes on obs vs wrf plots at SGP
JLCY

Generally for WD and w, between obs & wrf, the correlations are low, and the 
RMSEs are high. 

WD causes problems on metrics and graphics because of the 360-deg and 0-deg split.

Some taylor diagrams do not show all the data points because the standard 
deviations of the model variables are too big. 

>>> 2018-05-29 <<<

WS tay diag: 
erad01 > erad02 > gfs

models miss WD change badly between 6Z and 10Z 

gfs misses WS ramps between 6Z and 12Z badly

>>> 2018-05-30 <<<

WS tay diag: 
gfs > erad01 > erad02

gfs matches WD and WS ts the best, esp after 6Z

>>> 2018-07-07 <<<

WS tay diag: 
erad01 ~ gfs > erad02

gfs matches WS ts the best

>>> 2018-07-09 <<<

WS tay diag: 
none are good... 

all models overstate WS @ night

erad02 could depict w profile late afternoon

>>> 2018-07-10 <<<

WS tay diag: 
erad01 > erad02 > gfs

erad02 matches WS ts well for parts of the day

gfs matches WD the best

>>> 2018-08-05 <<<

WS tay diag: 
erad01 > gfs > erad02

all models match night time WS & WD well; only erad02 fit so-so w/ daytime WS

all models not do so well for daytime WD

>>> 2018-09-01 <<<

WS tay diag: 
gfs> erad01 ~ d02

gfs matches WD the best 

all models overstate WS, gfs overall is better
